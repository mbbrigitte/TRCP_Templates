# Instructions  {-}

 

If you need to highlight text, you can use _underscores_ or **asterixes** to do so. 

To refer to the results section, you can add use an at and ref to refer to it like here: \@ref(results). To add citations, write them in brackets like in this example  **knitr** [@xie2015].You will need to add those citations in the file book.bib in the correct format. book.bib needs to be saved in the same folder as your Rmd report file. 

You can add inline equations like this: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

# Abstract

<p class="boxedtext">
Summarize the study group, what type of study it is, the main methods and results. 
</p>

This here also serves as an example on how to highlight your text by making a grey box around it. Use the code used above and below this paragraph here. The styling class is defined as 'boxedtext'.


# Methods {#methods}


Clinical characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables were characterized using median and interquartile range; dichotomous or polytomous variables were characterized using frequencies. Between-group comparisons were evaluated using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests for dichotomous and polytomous variables.

The time to XY was summarized using the Kaplan-Meier curve. 

Analyses were performed using R version `r R.version.string` (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).


# Results {#results} 


In this study, we consider  `r length(unique(cars$study_id))` cars. The average speed was `r round(mean(cars$speed),2)`km/h. 



## Descriptive tables {.tabset}

The tabset is only if you have a huge number of tables, or if it is easier to compare them next to each other.

Here, `table_one()` reports mean and standard deviation and median and IQR for continuous variables; frequencies for dichotomous and polytomous variables. In presence of `group=` arguments, `table_one()` will perform two sample *t*-tests (with unequal variance) or Wilcoxon rank-sums tests if there are 2 groups; otherwise ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests if there are more than 2 groups. The summary for the grouping variable will not included in the grouped table.

### Cars  {-}

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tmp_tab  = table_one(cars) %>% 
  filter(!grepl("^study_id", row_id),
         !grepl("_meansd$", row_id)) %>% 
      select(var_desp,
             n,
             stat)
tmp_tab %>%  kable(caption = 'Summary of cars',
        booktabs=TRUE, 
        escape = FALSE,
        align= c('l', 'c','c'),
        col.names = c('Variable', 'N', 'Stat')) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), 
                full_width = FALSE) %>%
  add_indent(which(is.na(tmp_tab$n)))%>%
    scroll_box( height = "500px")

```

### Cars by colour {-}

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tmp_tab  = table_one(cars, group = colour) %>% 
  filter(!grepl("^study_id", row_id),
         !grepl("_meansd$", row_id)) %>% 
      select(var_desp,
             starts_with('blue'),starts_with('red'),
             pval)
tmp_tab %>%  kable(caption = 'Summary of cars by colour',
        booktabs=TRUE, 
        escape = FALSE,
        align= c('l', 'c','c','c','c','r'),
        col.names = c('Variable', 'N', 'Stat', 'N', 'Stat','p-value')) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), 
                full_width = FALSE) %>%
  add_header_above(c('','Blue'= 2, 'Red'= 2, '')) %>%
  add_indent(which(is.na(tmp_tab$n)))
