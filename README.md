# TRCP_Templates

This is  a R package to create standard reports. You can download and install it with the command

devtools::install_github('mbbrigitte/TRCP_Templates')

# How to use it
## Installation
If you have fanetc installed, no need to do anything as it is included in the fanetc-package. 

Open your R-studio (or Docker R-Studio) and install devtools. Then, you can install it through the command
devtools::install_github('mbbrigitte/TRCP_Templates'). 

## Useage
After installation, in your R-Studio, go to 
File  ->  New file  ->  R Markdown   (the third option from the drop down)

Then choose "From Template" and click on "Standard Report" from the TRCPTemplatePackage. You can then enter a name, this will be the folder name under which the report template markdown document will be available (the default name of the folder is 'Untitled').

The default file-name is "Untitled1" and if you try to knit the document, it will automatically prompt you to save under another name. 

## Errors and improvements
Please report errors and communicate anything that should be in the template to me.
